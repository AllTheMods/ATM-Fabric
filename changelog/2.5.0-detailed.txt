			More Information
			v1.7.0 Upgrade Info
			v1.7.0 of CraftPresence is the next major feature and technical update after v1.6.0. It is celebrating the recent milestones of over five million downloads as well as hitting the number one spot in Twitch Integration.
			This release holds numerous improvements over the Configuration System, as well as adding long-standing user requests and planned features that I've queued over time since v1.4.0s release, that are outlined in the changelog above.
			While no Config Migrations are necessary at this time for updating to v1.7.0, this can change as time goes on in the v1.7.x Pipeline, and will be noted here as such when and if these types of changes occur.
			More features will additionally be planned and added for later in the v1.7.x Pipeline as further releases arrive.
			1.13.x Build Info
			The Rift Edition of this Mod Requires the [Rift ModLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rift) and contains the following differences to take Note of:
			* KeyCodes have changed from an LWJGL Upgrade! Be Sure to check and edit your KeyBinds if migrating from 1.12.2 and below.
			Starting in v1.5.0, The 1.13 Rift Port of CraftPresence was deprecated in favor of the 1.13.2 Rift Port.
			Starting in v1.7.0, The aforementioned KeyCode warning is now void, due to new systems introduced to convert keybindings between LWJGL versions, and this message will be removed in v1.7.1.
			Note: Due to Maven Troubles on behalf of the Rift Team, Rift Versions are no longer supported as of v1.6.1, though the Differences do still take effect for Forge.
			1.14.x - 1.16.x Build Info
			Some 1.14.x, 1.15.x, and 1.16.x Ports of this Mod Require the [FabricMC ModLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and contains the same differences as the 1.13.x Port.
			Snapshot Build Info
			Some Versions of this Mod are for Minecraft Snapshots or Experimental Versions, and as such, caution should be noted.
			Any Snapshot Build Released will be marked as BETA to match its Snapshot Status depending on Tests done before release and issues found.
			Snapshot Builds, depending on circumstances, may also contain changes for a future version of the mod, and will be noted as so if this is the case.
			Legacy Build Info (Minecraft Versions 1.5.2 and Below)

		CraftPresence-Fabric v1.6.8 (1.15.2):
			CraftPresence Changes
			v1.6.8 (08/04/2020)
			Changes
			* Each release going forward will have a tag attached to it on the repository, going down to v1.4.0
			* Added a Fallback Switch for the config gui for if it is forced closed (Reference: [#69]())
			* RPC Formatting will now only capitalize the first word in the parameter, giving more control to the separate placeholders
			* Removed Support for &ID& Placeholders, to comply with some MC Version requisites

			More Information
			v1.6.0 Mod Rewrite Info
			In v1.6.0, CraftPresence has undergone numerous performance and under-the-hood improvements, to both acknowledge user feedback over the last several months and pursue the goal of further modularity.
			As Elements such as the Config System and General RPC Elements have undergone various changes, please report any bugs found to [the Issue Tracker]()
			Migration Notes:
			*
			The RPC System has changed to an internal IPC System hooking into Discord's official endpoints
			* As a result, you can remove any discord-rpc DLL files present in CraftPresence's folders as they are no longer being used
			*
			gameTimePlaceholder is now combined into the &worldinfo& Placeholder
			*
			Some other placeholders within Server and Status Messages have been changed or renamed, please refer to the in-game tooltips for these new names
			*
			Entity Messages now use the Default Message as the Format, while specific Item Messages are placeholders for the formatted string
			* This means, only &item& (The Specific Item's Name) will work for specific Items
			* Otherwise, the more familiar placeholders such as &main& and &offhand& will retrieve this message when part of the default format setting
			*
			Both &mods& and &ign& are now Generalized Placeholders and can only be called within the Presence Formatting GUI
			* &ign& in Server Messages should be changed to using &playerinfo& for in-world Player Data and &ign& for out-of-world Player Data
			*
			overwriteServerIcon has been deprecated, instead use the Presence Formatting GUI to define the priority for icons
			* Example: overwriteServerIcon = Setting smallImageKey to &PACK&&SERVER& (Having &PACK& be before anything else)

			v1.6.0 Mod Rewrite Info
			In v1.6.0, CraftPresence has undergone numerous performance and under-the-hood improvements, to both acknowledge user feedback over the last several months and pursue the goal of further modularity.
			As Elements such as the Config System and General RPC Elements have undergone various changes, please report any bugs found to [the Issue Tracker]()
			Migration Notes:
			*
			The RPC System has changed to an internal IPC System hooking into Discord's official endpoints
			* As a result, you can remove any discord-rpc DLL files present in CraftPresence's folders as they are no longer being used
			*
			gameTimePlaceholder is now combined into the &worldinfo& Placeholder
			*
			Some other placeholders within Server and Status Messages have been changed or renamed, please refer to the in-game tooltips for these new names
			*
			Entity Messages now use the Default Message as the Format, while specific Item Messages are placeholders for the formatted string
			* This means, only &item& (The Specific Item's Name) will work for specific Items
			* Otherwise, the more familiar placeholders such as &main& and &offhand& will retrieve this message when part of the default format setting
			*
			&mods& and &ign& are now Generalized Placeholders and can only be called within the Presence Formatting GUI
			* &ign& in Server Messages should be changed to using &playerinfo& for in-world Player Data and &ign& for out-of-world Player Data
			*
			overwriteServerIcon has been deprecated, instead use the Presence Formatting GUI to define the priority for icons
			* Example: overwriteServerIcon = Setting smallImageKey to &PACK&&SERVER& (Having &PACK& be before anything else)
			1.13.x Build Info
			The Rift Edition of this Mod Requires the [Rift ModLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rift) and contains the following differences to take Note of:
			* KeyCodes have changed from an LWJGL Upgrade! Be Sure to check and edit your KeyBinds if migrating from 1.12.2 and below.
			Starting in v1.5.0, The 1.13 Rift Port of CraftPresence was deprecated in favor of the 1.13.2 Rift Port
			1.14.x - 1.15.x Build Info
			The 1.14.x and 1.15.x Ports of this Mod Require the [FabricMC ModLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and contains the same differences as the 1.13.x Port
			Snapshot Build Info
			Some Versions of this Mod are based on Minecraft Snapshots, and as such, caution is advised.
			Any Snapshot Build Released will be marked as BETA to match its Snapshot Status
			Legacy Build Info (Minecraft Versions 1.5.2 and Below)
			Ports of this Mod for Minecraft Versions 1.5.2 and Lower are on very limited support.
			Please Keep in Mind the Following:
			* There is NO Support for Server RPC Displays from MC 1.2.5 and Below, due to modding limitations.
			* Bugs that relate with or are caused by issues in the Vanilla Codebase, are unlikely able to be fixed due to MC's limitations
			See the Mod Description // README for More Info

			Adds a system for declaring and getting default items for tags.

			* Recipe JSON "result" fields can have a "tag" field instead of an "item" field to use the default value of that tag for item output.
			* Loot tables can use a "libcd:defaulted_tag" entry to drop the default value of that tag for item output.

			* Tweakers can alternatively use the TweakerUtils.getDefaultItem method for getting the default value of an item tag.
			* Loot tweakers can now use the Entries.defaultedTag method to create a loot entry based on a libcd:defaulted_tag entry.
			* Cooking and cutting recipe JSONs can now take an object for their respective "result" fields along with the standard string value, allowing them to use default items and NBT in outputs.
			* The conditions libcd:item_tag_exists and libcd:block_tag_exists now require the tag to have at least on entry to be considered existent.
			* Inside of obfuscation, the TagHelper class and its TagHelper.ITEM implementation provide access to default resources at any time.
